    <h1>Vaishnavi Sidduri Presents</h1>

    <h4>KENT</h4>
    <p>I thought the king had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.</p>

    <h4>GLOUCESTER</h4>
    <p>It did always seem so to us: but now, in the division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the dukes he values most; for equalities are so weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice of either's moiety.</p>

    <h4>KENT</h4>
    <p>Is not this your son, my lord?</p>

    <h4>GLOUCESTER</h4>
    <p>His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am brazed to it.</p>

    <h4>KENT</h4>
    <p>I cannot conceive you.</p>

    <h4>GLOUCESTER</h4>
    <p>Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?</p>

    <h4>KENT</h4>
    <p>I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.</p>

    <h4>GLOUCESTER</h4>
    <p>But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account: though this knave came something saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet was his mother fair; there was good sport at his making, and the whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this noble gentleman, Edmund?</p>

    <h4>EDMUND</h4>
    <p>No, my lord.</p>
