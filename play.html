    <h1>Vaishnavi Sidduri Presents</h1>
    <h3>Hamlet</h3>
    <h6>Act 1, Scene 5 – The Ghost Speaks</h6>

    <p><strong>GHOST:</strong> I am thy father's spirit,  
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,  
    And for the day confined to fast in fires,  
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature  
    Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid  
    To tell the secrets of my prison-house,  
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word  
    Would harrow up thy soul.</p>

    <p>HAMLET: O God!</p>

    <p>GHOST: Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.</p>

    <p>HAMLET: Murder!</p>

    <p>GHOST: Murder most foul, as in the best it is;  
    But this most foul, strange and unnatural.</p>

    <p>HAMLET: Haste me to know it, that I, with wings as swift  
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,  
    May sweep to my revenge.</p>

    <p>GHOST:I find thee apt;  
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed  
    That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,  
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:  
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,  
    A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark  
    Is by a forged process of my death  
    Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,  
    The serpent that did sting thy father’s life  
    Now wears his crown.</p>

    <p>HAMLET:O my prophetic soul! My uncle!</p>

    <p>GHOST:Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,  
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts—  
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power  
    So to seduce!—won to his shameful lust  
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.</p>
