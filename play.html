    <h2>King Lear</h2>
    <h3>Act I, Scene I: King Lear's Palace</h3>
    <p><strong>Enter KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUND</strong></p>

    <h4 class="name kent">KENT</h4>
    <p class="speech">I thought the king had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.</p>

    <h4 class="name gloucester">GLOUCESTER</h4>
    <p class="speech">It did always seem so to us: but now, in the division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the dukes he values most; for equalities are so weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice of either's moiety.</p>

    <h4 class="name kent">KENT</h4>
    <p class="speech">Is not this your son, my lord?</p>

    <h4 class="name gloucester">GLOUCESTER</h4>
    <p class="speech">His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am brazed to it.</p>

    <h4 class="name kent">KENT</h4>
    <p class="speech">I cannot conceive you.</p>

    <h4 class="name gloucester">GLOUCESTER</h4>
    <p class="speech">Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?</p>

    <h4 class="name kent">KENT</h4>
    <p class="speech">I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.</p>

    <h4 class="name gloucester">GLOUCESTER</h4>
    <p class="speech">But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account: though this knave came something saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet was his mother fair; there was good sport at his making, and the whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this noble gentleman, Edmund?</p>

    <h4 class="name edmund">EDMUND</h4>
    <p class="speech">No, my lord.</p>

    <h4 class="name gloucester">GLOUCESTER</h4>
    <p class="speech">My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my honourable friend.</p>

    <h4 class="name edmund">EDMUND</h4>
    <p class="speech">My services to your lordship.</p>

    <h4 class="name kent">KENT</h4>
    <p class="speech">I must love you, and sue to know you better.</p>

    <h4 class="name edmund">EDMUND</h4>
    <p class="speech">Sir, I shall study deserving.</p>

    <h4 class="name gloucester">GLOUCESTER</h4>
    <p class="speech">He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again. The king is coming.</p>

    <p><strong>Sennet. Enter KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and Attendants.</strong></p>

    <h4 class="name king-lear">KING LEAR</h4>
    <p class="speech">Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.</p>

    <h4 class="name gloucester">GLOUCESTER</h4>
    <p class="speech">I shall, my liege.</p>

    <p><strong>Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND.</strong></p>

    <h4 class="name king-lear">KING LEAR</h4>
    <p class="speech">Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.</p>
    <p class="stage-direction">[Give me the map there. Know that we have divided in three our kingdom...]</p>
