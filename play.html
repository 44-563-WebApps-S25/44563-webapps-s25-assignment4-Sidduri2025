   <h2>King Lear</h2>
    <h3>Act I, Scene I - King Learâ€™s Palace</h3>

    <p>ENT: I thought the king had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.</p>
    <p>GLOUCESTER: It did always seem so to us: but now, in the division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the dukes he values most; for equalities are so weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice of either's moiety.</p>
    <p>KENT: Is not this your son, my lord?</p>
    <p>GLOUCESTER: His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am brazed to it.</p>
    <p>KENT: I cannot conceive you.</p>
    <p>GLOUCESTER: Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?</p>
    <p>KENT: I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.</p>
    <p>GLOUCESTER: But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account: though this knave came something saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet was his mother fair; there was good sport at his making, and the whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this noble gentleman, Edmund?</p>
    <p>EDMUND: No, my lord.</p>
